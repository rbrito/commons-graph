      <p>A <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/graph/Graph.html">Graph</a> data structure consists of a finite set of
      ordered pairs, called <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/graph/Edge.html">Edge</a>s or arcs, of certain entity
      called <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/graph/Vertex.html">Vertex</a> or node.</p>

      <p>An <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/graph/UndirectedGraph.html">UndirectedGraph</a> is one in which edges
      have no orientation. The edge <code>(a, b)</code> is identical to the edge <code>(b, a)</code>, i.e., they are not
      ordered pairs, but sets {u, v} (or 2-multisets) of vertices.</p>

      <p>A <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/graph/DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> is a Graph where an
      edge <code>e = (a, b)</code> is considered to be directed from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>;
      <code>a</code> is called the head and <code>b</code> is called the tail of the arc.</p>
