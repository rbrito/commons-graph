      <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)">graph</a> 
      is an abstract structure in which objects can be linked together to represent relationships between them.
      Graphs and graph-based data structures are at the core of many real-world domains and applications:
      typical examples include communication networks, databases, chemical structures, social networks and so on. 
      Graphs can be implemented in different ways, based on the specific domain and usage patterns.</p>
      
      <p>Commons Graph provides simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent APIs</a> 
      to manage graph-based data structures and execute standard operations and algorithms on them. </p>
      
      <p>Some of the features of Commons Graph are listed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A highly abstract domain for graph components and types, together with related base implementations.</li>
        <li>Standard algorithms such as shortest path, maximum flow, spanning tree and so on.</li>
        <li>Customizable properties of graphs and graph components such as labels and weights.</li>
        <li>An I/O utility that allows to export graphs to well-known file formats.</li>
      </ul>
